## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Taking properties out of an object or array and assigning them directly to variables.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  On the left side of the assignment operator, const or let is followed by curly braces `{}` containing the property name(s) from an object, which can then be followed with a colon and be named individually, on the right side goes the name of the object.

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  On the left side of the assignment operator, const or let is followed by brackets `[]` containing one or a list of comma separated variable names, ordered to represent their position in the array being deconstructed. The array being deconstructed is placed on the right side.

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  By which side of the assignment operator `=` the brackets or curly brackets are placed on.
