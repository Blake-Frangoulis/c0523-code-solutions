## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function packs up code for reuse throughout a program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The parts of definining a function include: the function keyword, an optional name, a comma separated list of zero or more parameters surrounded by parentheses, the start of the functions code block indicated by an opening curly brace, an optional return statement, and the end of the code block indicated by a closing curly brace.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The parts of calling a function are: the functions name and a comma-separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The definition is used to set up the function while the call is used to use the function that was previously definted.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  The parmeter is a placeholder used when defining a function while the argument is used when calling a function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are useful to hold the value for an argument.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A return statement causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program and prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
