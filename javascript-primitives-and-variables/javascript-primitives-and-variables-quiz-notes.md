## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  The purpose of a variable is to store information.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  You can declare a variable using the var, let, or const keywords and using the assignment operator '=' to assign it a value.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  Using the assignment operator '=', the variable name on the left is assigned the value on the right.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Variable names can contain letters, digits, or the symbols '$' and '\_'. Variable names cannot start with a number.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  The capitalization of every letter in a variable name matters. Otherwise it is not the same variable.

  Strings are used to store textual data.

- What is the purpose of a number?
  Numbers are used to represent integers.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  Booleans are used to store binary "Yes-or-No" values.

  The assignment operator assigns the value on its right to what is on its left.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  Using the assignment operator (`=`), you can assign a new value to it, or perform operations and update its current value.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  Null means the variable has an empty value while undefined means the variable has not been assigned any form of value.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  Labels make things much clearer as to what variables are being logged and in what order.
